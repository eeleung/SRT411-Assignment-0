# SRT411-Assignment-0
This assignment shows me how to create random number plots and write some scripts and configure how some of the graphs look. I was able to complete the ToDos from this text https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf and learned more about R and how to use Rstudio.
